Pixell River Financial API

Assignment 2 – Backend Development Using Node.js + TypeScript + Firestore

## Project Overview

This API is designed to manage the branches and employees of Pixell River Financial.
It supports full CRUD functionality so branches and employees can be added, updated, retrieved, or deleted easily.

The logic is cleanly separated into routes, controllers, services, and repositories, making the project organized and scalable.

You can also filter employees by branch or department, which is very helpful when you need specific information about a group of staff members.
